## Workflow:
1. Created Headers using "#" and "##"
2. Emphasis using "_ _" and "* *"
3. Created a list of the cities that I lived in
4. Combined a link with an image:
5. "Review Assignment Due Date" at the beginning of the assignment showed a great example of how the link and picture can be connected and work together. That is a new markdown functionality I learned.


Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)
